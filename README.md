# [New Server Promoter]
## Information
This plugin was created to help server owners mitigate their playerbase from their old game server over to their new game server. Usually when changing server provider, or simply moving your server to a different ip-address or port, it can usually take quite a chunk of the player base. More often than not, this is because not all players may know a new server is up and running. This plugin tries to combat this issue.
When this plugin is installed on your server messages in the player's console, chat, hint text area and at the middle of their screen will appear, informing them about the new server's IP, encouraging them to add the new server's IP to their favorites.
